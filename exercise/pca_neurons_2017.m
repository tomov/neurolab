%% PCA on simulated neurons
%
% Guidance is provided via comments and example code below.
%
% To make this script easier to use, the task is broken into  sections,
% each section with a bold header (those starting with '%%') can be run by
% themselves (without running the entire script) using "ctrl + enter"
% (Windows) or "command + enter" (MAC). Just place your cursor within one of
% these sections (the section will become highlighted) to allow this functionality.

% This section of the code plots the stimulus and the responses for the

% Explore ways to compare how similar the responses are of neuronal pairs.
% Think about what would be good similarity metrics to compare neuronal
% responses. Try to implement these if you want.


%% Generate the covariance matrix
% Use the 'cov' function to calculate the covariance matrix.  The 'cov'
% function automatically centers the data so you do not need to do this. 
% This function will return a matrix that has variance along the diagonal
% entries and the covariance in the off-diagonal entries.

% Note that for this data we could either calculate a covariance matrix of
% how different neurons covary together or of how different time points
% covary together. (i.e. we calculate either how the rows or columns of the
% data matrix covary). Recall that our goal in the end is to use PCA to
% reduce the dimensionality of the data from 58 neurons to a smaller number
% of ‘principal component’ neurons so think about which covariance matrix
% is most useful to us if we want to achieve this goal.

% Hint: Type 'doc cov' in the command window to look up how the 'cov'
% function works. 

% You have done this correctly if dataCov(1,1) = 1.0474

% Replace the [] with your own code below.

corrcoefs = nan(size(data, 1), 1);

%% Cluster the covariance matrix
% use the kmeans function with the covariance matrix as input. Think about
% how many cluster (k) to input.

% The output will be a list of cluster IDs. Find all the neurons that
% belong to cluster 1, cluster 2, and so on. Plot the responses of all the
% neurons in cluster 1 and compare them to the stimulus vs. time plot. Use
% similar plotting approaches to those used in Part 1.

%% Perform PCA
% Use the 'pca' function to run PCA on the data matrix. Your goal is to
% analyze the relationships among neurons, not the relationships among
% time points. Your hypothesis is that the responses of all 58 neurons
% can be reduced to linear combinations of a few orthogonal basis
% functions, where each basis function can be conceptualized as a
% distinct "response type". You should set up the PCA so that you obtain
% 58 PCs; you hypothesize that only a few of these PCs are needed to
% explain most of the variance in the data.

% The 'pca' function returns several values. For us the important ones are:
% 
%   'score' - This is a matrix containing the representation of the data
%       set in PC space. Essentially, this is the data set after it has
%       been rotated. Recall that the original data set consisted of 58
%       vectors, with each vector representing a neural response measured
%       at 5000 time points; this new matrix therefore also consists of 58
%       vectors measured at 5000 time points. Note that there is some
%       confusion of terminology in the literature.  Sometimes the PC
%       scores are referred to as the "Principal components (PCs)" while
%       other times our new axes (the eigenvectors) are called the
%       "Principal components". We prefer the second usage and hence we
%       will refer to the scores as "PC scores" and to the axes as PCs but
%       you should be familiar with both.
%   'explained' - This is a list of numbers quantifying the percentage of
%       the variance in the data explained by each of the PCs, in 
%       descending order of variance explained.
%   'coeff' - This is a matrix that quantifies the importance of each
%       variable (here, each neuron in the original dataset) in accounting 
%       for the variability of the associated PC. (This matrix gets the 
%       name 'coeff' because it contains the correlation coefficients 
%       between the data in PC space and the original data.) These values 
%       are also known as loadings. Each column of coeff contains 
%       coefficients for one principal component, and the columns are in 
%       descending order of component variance.

% Read the help documentation on pca for further information. 

% If you're confused, we recommend first performing PCA and the plotting
% steps below and then coming back to revise your code based on your
% results. Plotting the outputs from the pca function can be helpful for
% understanding what pca is doing.

% You have done this correctly if coeff(1,1) = 0.0724

% =======================
% Insert/Modify code here

% =======================

% each neuron is a variable, each time point is an observation

% eigenvectors = how much does each of the original neurons contribute to
% the given eigen"neuron"
% score matrix = how much weight you're putting on each eigenneuron at each
% time point
%
% each vector in the space is a set of firing rates for all the neurons = (r1, r2, r3, .... r58)
% each column = a time point = another vector in the space
% so we have 5000 vectors of 58 firing rates each
%
% each component in old vector space = firing of a given neuron
% each PC (in new space) = linear sum of firing of the given neurons = an "eigenneuron"
%                        = (1, 0, 0, ... 0) * w1 + (0, 1, 0 ... 0) * w2 + 
%                          ... + (0, 0, ..., 1) * w58
%      they're all orthogonal (almost)
%
% score matrix: each column = weights for how much each principle component
% contributes to the given vector of firing rates (the given time point)
%
% coefficients = each neuron (component/axis in the old space) can be expressed
% as a linear combination of the eigenvectors/new axes = the "eigenneurons"
%
% multiply coeff by score to get the original data in terms of the PCs --
% can only use e.g. top 3 PCs
% e.g. coeff(58,1) * score(t,1) = how neuron 58 maps to PC 1 at time t
%      coeff(58,2) * score(t,2) = how neuron 58 maps to PC 2 at time t
%      coeff(58,3) * score(t,3) = how neuron 58 maps to PC 3 at time t
%
% so score(t,1) = the projected data; the magnitude of the vector at time t
% onto PC 1
%    score(t,2) = the projection of vector at time t on PC 2
%
% btw -- # of clusters and # of PCs are generally unrelated!!!
% can have many clusters with few PCs, or just 1 cloud and many PCs
% separate ideas!
